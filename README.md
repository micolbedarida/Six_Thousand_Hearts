# Six_Thousand_Hearts

This is the code that is behind the 6000 hearts Tableau visualisation which can be found on my Tableau Public profile here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/micol.bedarida/viz/6000Hearts/Interactivelogo

The outline of the code was taken from: https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/brian-scally/plotting-data-to-image-pixels-in-tableau-data-prep-with-r/
